# AKS-Engine

The Azure Kubernetes Engine (`aks-engine`) generates ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates for Kubernetes clusters on Microsoft Azure. The input to aks-engine is a cluster definition file which describes the desired cluster, including orchestrator, features, and agents. The structure of the input files is very similar to the public API for Azure Kubernetes Service.

## Install

Binary downloads for the latest version of aks-engine for are available [here](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/releases/latest). Download `aks-engine` for your operating system. Extract the binary and copy it to your `$PATH`.

You can also choose to install aks-engine using [gofish](https://gofi.sh/#about), to do so execute the command `gofish install aks-engine` . You can install gofish following the [instructions](https://gofi.sh/#install) for your OS.

If you would prefer to build `aks-engine` from source or you are interested in contributing to `aks-engine` see [building from source](#build-aks-engine-from-source) below.

## Completion

`aks-engine` supports bash completion. To enable this, add the following to your `.bashrc` or `~/.profile`

```bash
source <(aks-engine completion)
```

## Usage

`aks-engine` reads a JSON [cluster definition](../topics/clusterdefinitions.md) and generates a number of files that may be submitted to Azure Resource Manager (ARM). The generated files include:

1. **apimodel.json**: is an expanded version of the cluster definition provided to the generate command. All default or computed values will be expanded during the generate phase.
2. **azuredeploy.json**: represents a complete description of all Azure resources required to fulfill the cluster definition from `apimodel.json`.
3. **azuredeploy.parameters.json**: the parameters file holds a series of custom variables which are used in various locations throughout `azuredeploy.json`.
4. **certificate and access config files**: orchestrators like Kubernetes require certificates and additional configuration files (e.g. Kubernetes apiserver certificates and kubeconfig).

### Generate Templates

AKS Engine consumes a cluster definition which outlines the desired shape, size, and configuration of Kubernetes. There are a number of features that can be enabled through the cluster definition.

See [AKS Engine The Long Way](deploy.md#aks-engine-the-long-way) for an example on generating templates by hand.

### Deploy Templates

Generated templates can be deployed using [the Azure CLI 2.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) or [Powershell](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell).

#### Deploying with Azure CLI 2.0

Azure CLI 2.0 is the latest CLI maintained and supported by Microsoft. For installation instructions see [the Azure CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli#installation) for the latest release.

```bash
$ az login

$ az account set --subscription "<SUBSCRIPTION NAME OR ID>"

$ az group create \
    --name "<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>" \
    --location "<LOCATION>"

$ az group deployment create \
    --name "<DEPLOYMENT NAME>" \
    --resource-group "<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>" \
    --template-file "./_output/<INSTANCE>/azuredeploy.json" \
    --parameters "./_output/<INSTANCE>/azuredeploy.parameters.json"
```

#### Deploying with Powershell

```powershell
Add-AzureRmAccount

Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionID <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>

New-AzureRmResourceGroup `
    -Name <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> `
    -Location <LOCATION>

New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment `
    -Name <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> `
    -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> `
    -TemplateFile _output\<INSTANCE>\azuredeploy.json `
    -TemplateParameterFile _output\<INSTANCE>\azuredeploy.parameters.json
```

## Build AKS Engine from Source

### Docker Development Environment

The easiest way to start hacking on `aks-engine` is to use a Docker-based environment. If you already have Docker installed then you can get started with a few commands.

* Windows (PowerShell): `.\scripts\devenv.ps1`
* Linux/OSX (bash): `./scripts/devenv.sh`

This script mounts the `aks-engine` source directory as a volume into the Docker container, which means you can edit your source code in your favorite editor on your machine, while still being able to compile and test inside of the Docker container. This environment mirrors the environment used in the aks-engine continuous integration (CI) system.

When the script `devenv.ps1` or `devenv.sh` completes, you will be left at a command prompt.

Run the following commands to pull the latest dependencies and build the `aks-engine` tool.

```sh
# install and download build dependencies
make bootstrap
# build the `aks-engine` binary
make build
```

The build process leaves the compiled `aks-engine` binary in the `bin` directory. Make sure everything completed successfully by running `bin/aks-engine` without any arguments:

```sh
$ ./bin/aks-engine
AKS Engine deploys and manages Kubernetes, Swarm Mode, and DC/OS clusters in Azure

Usage:
  aks-engine [command]

Available Commands:
  deploy        Deploy an Azure Resource Manager template
  generate      Generate an Azure Resource Manager template
  help          Help about any command
  orchestrators Display info about supported orchestrators
  scale         Scale an existing Kubernetes cluster
  upgrade       Upgrade an existing Kubernetes cluster
  version       Print the version of AKS Engine

Flags:
      --debug   enable verbose debug logs
  -h, --help    help for aks-engine

Use "aks-engine [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Building on Windows, OSX, and Linux

Building AKS Engine from source has a few requirements for each of the platforms. Download and install the pre-reqs for your platform, Windows, Linux, or Mac:

### Prerequisite

1. Go version 1.8 [installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Git Version Control [installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/download/)
